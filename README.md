## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties


### What I learned

I learned more about spacing and positioning elements, what resulted in a better understanding of margins and paddings. 


### Continued development

I am more focussing on margings, paddings, and css-grid kind of stuff. I still have a lot to learn and practise about css-grid, floats, flexbox and more.
